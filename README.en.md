## About the project

> [!WARNING]
> The project is still under development and prediction results are not reliable at all.
>
> Moreover, the web may take up to 30 seconds to start if it hasn't had recent traffic.
 
> [!NOTE]
> Advanced processing with Machine Learning is still pending in order to obtain reliable predictions.
> 
> Truly effective predictions require intensive mathematical processing.
>
> All documentation regarding these calculations and the full mathematical process will be available in the Jupyter Notebooks once the project is completed.
